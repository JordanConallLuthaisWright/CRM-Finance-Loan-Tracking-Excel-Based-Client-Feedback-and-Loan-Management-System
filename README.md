## **Project Overview**
Many small and medium-sized businesses use Excel for **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** due to its accessibility and ease of use. However, Excel lacks built-in automation features found in advanced CRM platforms like **Salesforce, HubSpot, and Zoho**. This project leverages **VBA Macros** to introduce **automated tracking, logging, and retrieval** of client data in an Excel-based CRM system.

## **Technical Implementation**
### 1. **VBA Macros for Event-Driven Logging**
- **Automatically logs client feedback** when changes occur in specified columns.  
- **Stores previous interactions** for quick reference.  

```vba
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("LogSheet") ' Ensure this sheet exists

    ' Check if the change was made in Column M
    If Not Intersect(Target, Me.Range("M:M")) Is Nothing Then
        Application.EnableEvents = False ' Prevent infinite loops
        On Error GoTo ErrorHandler ' Error handling

        ' Insert a new row at Row 2 (pushing old entries down)
        ws.Rows(2).Insert Shift:=xlDown

        ' Log details in LogSheet
        ws.Cells(2, 1).Value = Now ' Timestamp (Column A)
        ws.Cells(2, 2).Value = Me.Cells(Target.Row, 2).Value ' Client (Column B)
        ws.Cells(2, 3).Value = Target.Value ' Note (Column C)
    End If

ExitHandler:
    Application.EnableEvents = True ' Re-enable events
    Exit Sub

ErrorHandler:
    MsgBox "Error: " & Err.Description, vbCritical
    Resume ExitHandler
End Sub
```
